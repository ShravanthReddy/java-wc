Hi, this is the test file to check if the wc tool written in Java is working.
It has features such as word, line and byte counter along with additional features such as:
1. Each Word Counter - Which will give the count of each word in the file or standard input.
2. Highest repeated word - This will output the word and its count that are repeated the most in the file.
